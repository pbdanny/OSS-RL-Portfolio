# Data manipulations
# Highlight and run command below do load project without munging.
# This is useful when debugging data manipulation code.
# rm(list = ls()); library(ProjectTemplate); load.project(list(munging=FALSE)) 

# It is often useful to create sets of variable names
# By convention, the list that stores these variable sets is called 'v'
# v <- list()
